## 🔧 Intelligent Hierarchical Routing

The system uses **LLM-based routing** to intelligently direct requests to appropriate teams:

### Team Routing Logic

| Request Type | Target Team | Example Use Cases |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Development Tasks** | Development Team | "create a FastAPI endpoint", "build React component" |
| **Research Tasks** | Research Team | "research best practices", "analyze architecture" |
| **Documentation Tasks** | Documentation Team | "write API docs", "create tutorial" |
| **Simple Greetings** | Direct Response | "hello", "hi", "thanks" |

### LLM-Based Routing Example
```python
class Router(TypedDict):
    """Structured output for LLM-based routing decisions."""
    next: Literal["development_team", "research_team", "documentation_team", "FINISH"]

def route_with_llm(state: CodeHeroState) -> Command:
    """Use LLM to make routing decisions with structured output."""
    system_prompt = """You are a routing supervisor for a hierarchical agent system.
    
    Route requests to appropriate teams:
    - development_team: For coding, APIs, frontend/backend development
    - research_team: For research, analysis, strategic planning
    - documentation_team: For writing docs, guides, tutorials
    - FINISH: For simple greetings or when task is complete
    """
    
    response = llm.with_structured_output(Router).invoke([
        SystemMessage(content=system_prompt),
        *messages
    ])
    
    return Command(goto=response["next"])
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Hierarchical Agent Interaction
```bash
# Simple greeting - handled directly
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/chat/?message=hello"

# Development request - routed to Development Team
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/chat/?message=create%20a%20FastAPI%20endpoint"

# Research request - routed to Research Team  
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/chat/?message=research%20best%20practices%20for%20API%20design"

# Documentation request - routed to Documentation Team
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/chat/?message=write%20documentation%20for%20this%20API"
```

### Infrastructure Status Check
```bash
# Check infrastructure health
python -c "
import asyncio
from src.code_hero.hierarchical_agents import validate_full_infrastructure
async def check():
    status = await validate_full_infrastructure()
    print(f'Status: {status[\"overall_status\"]}')
    print(f'Healthy: {status[\"healthy_components\"]}')
    print(f'Failed: {status[\"failed_components\"]}')
asyncio.run(check())
"
```

### Direct Agent Interaction
```bash
# Interact with specific agent
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/agents/agent_code_generator/interact?message=generate%20fibonacci%20code"

# Get agent status
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/agents/agent_fastapi_expert/status"

# List all agents
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/agents/"
```

### Traditional LangGraph Workflow
```bash
# Use traditional routing (fallback)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/chat/?message=create%20a%20python%20function%20for%20fibonacci"
```
